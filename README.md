## Overview of the analysis: 
  The purpose of this analysis is to study and research the Citibike business in New York to guide them in setting up a similar city bicycle business in Des Moines, Iowa.  

## Results: 
  The 1st page shows that their business model is based off of a vast majority of subscribers rather than pay-as-use customers.  In addition, most of the subscribers are male.

 ## Summary: 
   When looking at the two sheets, “Beginning of Trip by Geographic” and “End of the trip by Geographic”  we confirmed the reason for such a low trip duration time of 5 minutes that was represented by the 4th page of CitiBike NYC Story.  Here we can see that the vast majority of users are using the Citibikes to travel a short distance.  This can be seen by the amount of densely colored large circles within a small area, indicating a high amount of start trips and end trips.  This data is very important to consider when opening a bike business in Des Moines, Iowa, because the city may not be as dense and traffic may be lighter.
